# From Music to Code

What began as a love for guitar and music composition became a passion for production and sound design. Ableton was an excellent gateway drug into software. Looking back, it's hard to tell if I was more interested in the music or just pushing the DAW as far as I could. After completing a multimedia music project and spending months grinding self promotion on social media, I was dissatisfied. Years of releases, combined with an admittedly half baked marketing strategy, had not resulted in the music career I naively thought it would, something had to change.


# Self Taught Developer

I had always been interested by programming, but I believed it was 'too complicated' for the likes of a grug brain like myself. The accessibility that ChatGPT brought to programming was the push I needed to really dive into it. I began writing stupid little Python scripts with the help of GPT-3.5, and eventually found myself fascinated with machine learning models, which led me to moving to a part time position at my day job to study machine learning on my own.

A few months later I was grinding through the Fast.ai program led by Jeremy Howard. I had few classification and fine-tuned models under my belt and I wanted to go for something a little more ambitious. So, I became an unofficial member of my friend's senior capstone project group. We were to build a speech separation model using a RAG architecture. We failed, but learned a lot, and I had to admit to myself that I had significant gap in my knowledge of computer science that was holding me back.

Since then, I've taken multiple online computer science courses and decided to learn Rust in the hopes that it's complexity would make other languages relatively easier to learn, an assumption which has paid off for the most part. I'm now significantly less inept at programming.
