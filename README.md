## Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is Ezra Klitsie

Self taught developer 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Consoxide](https://github.com/voidKandy/Consoxide), an advanced chat interface for language models powered by Rust
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust backend development through the [Zero to Production](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/zero-to-production) book 
 

## Tools/Languages
### Rust
Out of all the languages I work in, Rust is by far my favorite. The majority of my learning comes from building, though I have read all the way through the **Rust Book** and I'm working through the **Zero to Production** book to learn backend development. Thus far I have been involved with three projects using Rust. 
 - A very simple CLI for storing and retrieving passwords
 - **Showbeam**, a markdown slideshow website which has a Rust backend
 - **Consoxide**, my personal Ai Assistant application
## Javascript/Typescript



an LLM assistant application. **Consoxide** is still in development, but is close to being live as a dockerized assistant application with a native GUI.
