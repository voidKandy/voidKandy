# Ezra Klitsie
aka. [voidkandy](https://www.voidkandy.space)

My name is Ezra Klitsie, I’m a musician, artist and problem solver. Void Kandy began as a psuedonym to release music under, but it has evolved to encapsulate the entirety of my digital footprint.

Through programs like Harvard’s CS50, fast.ai and Coursera, as well as countless hours spent simply reading the docs, I’ve taught myself to write software across multiple languages and domains.

I have professional experience in web development on both the front and back end, and personal experience creating tools, experimenting with distributed systems, and exploring graphics programming. My journey has been entirely self-directed, guided by curiosity and the desire to understand how things work.

I’m now looking for opportunities where I can bring that same drive to learn, build, and problem-solve in a collaborative environment.
