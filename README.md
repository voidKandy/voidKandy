I'm a self taught developer working primarily in `Go` and `Rust`. I build websites as a freelancer and I've build my own AI powered tools. Recently I've been researching P2P networking and I'm trying to write my own blockchain. I *genuinely* love building software, the more I learn the more I want to build.
