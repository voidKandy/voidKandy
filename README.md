## Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is Ezra Klitsie

I am a mostly self taught developer working mostly in Rust and Typescript. I have a passionate interest in Ai and Machine learning models 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Consoxide](https://github.com/voidKandy/Consoxide), an advanced chat interface for language models powered by Rust
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust backend development through the [Zero to Production](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/zero-to-production) book 
 

## Tools/Languages
### Rust
Out of all the languages I work in, Rust is by far my favorite. The majority of my learning comes from building, though I have read all the way through the **Rust Book** and I'm working through the **Zero to Production** book to learn backend development. Thus far I have been involved with three projects using Rust. 
 - A very simple CLI for storing and retrieving passwords
 - **Showbeam**, a markdown slideshow website which has a Rust backend
 - **Consoxide**, my personal Ai Assistant application
### Javascript/Typescript
Similarly to Rust, most of my experience and understanding of Javascript/Typescript has come from building in the languages. I started writing Typescript as an front-end intern for a startup I worked for from Fed 2023 - June 2023. Since then I have also built a password manager written in pure Javascript, and written my portfolio website as well as **Showbeam's** front end in Typescript.
### Python
My very first program was a Python program that used the Dall-E API to turn wav files into images. On top of that, I have also fine tuned Davinci-003 using data gathered from web scrapers I wrote using the Beautiful Soup library. My time in the Fast.ai program gave me extensive experience trainging models using both fast.ai's library as well as Pytorch.
