## Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is Ezra Klitsie

### I spent 5 years as a full-time musician before realizing that software and machine learning were better suited for my psychological makeup. 

What started as a love for guitar and music composition became a passion for production and sound design. Ableton was an excellent gateway drug into software. It was hard to tell if I was more interested in the music or in pushing the DAW as far as I could. After completing a multimedia music project and spending months grinding self-promotion on social media, I was dissatisfied. Years of releases had not resulted in the music career I naively thought it would; something had to change. The release of ChatGPT led to the discovery of Python. Because of the chatbot, programming became much more accessible to me. Pair programming stupid little .py scripts with GPT-3.5 eventually led to a fascination with machine learning. That fascination led to a genuine attempt to create my own models until the unfortunate reality of my lack of software knowledge got in the way. Since then, I've been obsessed with expanding my knowledge of software. 

Check my repos for some personal projects I've had a fun time working on such as:
* Espionox, my own LLM library written in Rust
* An experimental AI LSP project
* Bureau, A chatGPT clone with more features
